# NodeSchool Lesson Module Solutions

Want to learn Node at your own pace?

Love JavaScript and ready to branch into the Server world?

Check out [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/)

These solutions are my own, saved here for personal reference and to assist others as they complete modules and face the same sorts of challenges I did.

However, if you are working on [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) module lessons I recommend you refer to these solutions only as reference or for problems upon which you are truly stuck.

Perfect practice makes perfect!
